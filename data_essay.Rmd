# Introduction

As you know by now, this is an R Markdown document. By this point in the semester, you should be familiar with how this works. We still want to give you some tips if you want to write your data essay in R Markdown.

We want you to submit your data essay in .pdf format. You can generate .pdf files from your .Rmd files. This is done by selecting `Knit` > `Knit to pdf`. If this does not work yet on yur computer, run the following code:


# Organizing the write-up with section titles

You can use `#` hashtags to organize you write-up with section-titles on different levels. This is how it works:

# Section

## Subsection

## Subsubsection

### Subsubsubsection

Markdown can do many more things: 

## Text formatting options

Markdown also provides an easy way to format the text in your document. Here are some basics:

  - *This text is italic*
  - **This text is bold**
  - `This is code`
  - [This is a link to the R Markdown homepage](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

For more formatting options, we recommend the [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.195559076.94966807.1602002830-1180689241.1600075670).

# Chunk Options

As you know, you can write code in R Markdown. This means, that you can do the coding and the write up in one single document. This is a great feature because it ensures that it will be easy to reproduce your document right away. However, to get a good looking write up, you most likely (especially if it should like in a journal article) only want to show tables and figures but hide the code in your final document. This is not difficult to achieve in R Markdown. You only have to adjust chunk options.

Chunk output in your final document can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the `{}` of a chunk header. Here are some useful arguments:

  - `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks. This is useful for running your data pre-processing and models.
  - `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
  - `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
  - `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
  - `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to a figure produced by the chunk.

See the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.169319849.94966807.1602002830-1180689241.1600075670) for a complete list of knitr chunk options.

# Example

Let's do an example: We want to simulate some data and create a plot. But the write up should only show the plot without any code.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# we simulate some data
# althoug we want to run this code, it should not appear in the write-up
# that's why we include 'include=FALSE' in the chunk options above

x <- runif(1000, 1, 4)
y <- runif(1000, 1, 4)

col <- round(x*y)
```

```{r single-plot, echo = FALSE, dpi=300, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='A colorful plot'}

# we set a couple of options:

# echo=FALSE makes sure that we show the output of the chunk (but not the code)
# dpi=300 makes sure that the resolution of the plot is high enough
# fig.width=7 defines the relative with of the plot
# fig.height=7 defines the relative height of the plot

You can even cross-reference Figures in your text. For this to work you need to install the bookdown package and set the output to bookdown::pdf_document2. You can see how to do this in the yaml header of this document. Instead of knit to pdf_document you can then use knit to pdf_document2. 

You just have to set a chunk name and use it like: In Figure \@ref(fig:single-plot) you can see very colorful points. You can also include calculated values directly in your text. The minimum value on the x-axis is `r round(min(x), 2)` and the mean value on the x-axis is `r round(mean(x), 2)`.

You can also plot two (or more) plots next to each other. You can see these in Figure \@ref(fig:two-plots).^[This is a footnote.]

```{r two-plots, echo = FALSE, dpi=300, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Two colorful plots'}

# we set a couple of options:

# echo=FALSE makes sure that we show the output of the chunk (but not the code)
# dpi=300 makes sure that the resolution of the plot is high enough
# fig.width=7 defines the relative with of the plot
# fig.height=3.5 defines the relative height of the plot
# out.width='100%' defines the total width of the plot
# fig.align='center' defines the alignment of the plot
# fig.cap='Two colorful plots' generates a caption for the plot

# generate a 1 by 2 plot window
par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
    # we reduce the blank space around the plot 
    # (where axis labels and titles are usually plotted)
    mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0) + 0.1) 

plot(x = x,
     y = y,
     xlim = c(1, 4),
     ylim = c(1, 4),
     xaxt = "n",
     yaxt = "n",
     pch = 19,
     bty = "n",
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "",
     col = viridis(max(col), 0.5)[col])

plot(x = x,
     y = y,
     xlim = c(1, 4),
     ylim = c(1, 4),
     xaxt = "n",
     yaxt = "n",
     pch = 22,
     cex = 2,
     bty = "n",
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "",
     col = viridis(round(max(x)), 0.5)[round(x)])
```

You also might to show a table (e.g. regression table) and reference Table \@ref(tab:regression) in your text.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

# we set three options here:

# echo=FALSE makes sure that we show the output of the chunk (but not the code)
# message=FALSE hides all messages created in the code chunk
# warning=FALSE hides all warnings created in the code chunk
# results='asis' makes sure that the table gets printed nicely

# note that for this to work, you must define "stargazer_opt" in the setup chunk
# as we did in this file (see line 45).

linear_model <- lm(y ~ x)

stargazer(linear_model, # You can also add more than just one model
          type = stargazer_opt, # Important to produce a nice table in the output document
          covariate.labels = c("X"), # Make sure to have the labels in the right order
          dep.var.labels = c("Y"),
          header = F, # To surpress the stargazer comment
          label = "tab:regression", # If you produce pdf output you can even cross-reference your table in your text.
          title = "Regression Table")
```
